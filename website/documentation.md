Documentation
=============

There are a few places that you can look for documentation on Redexer:

- There is a [tutorial](/tutorial.html) covering the basic concepts in
  redexer and how to extend it with a tool to instrument apps to dump
  logging information.

- You can generate HTML or TeX based documentation using `ocamldoc`:

        make doc

- You can also [browse the redexer API online](/doc/index.html)

- There are a number of sample extensions in the redexer source branch
  under `src/ext/`, that do things like pretty printing, lightweight
  static analysis, etc...
